/*
Route Between Nodes: Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

/*
Minimal Tree: Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, 
  write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
*/

/*
List of Depths: Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth 
  (e.g., if you have a tree with depth 0, you'll have 0 linked lists).
