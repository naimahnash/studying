This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string consisting of parentheses, single digits, and positive and negative signs, 
  convert the string into a mathematical expression to obtain the answer.

Don't use eval or a similar built-in parser.

For example, given '-1 + (2 + 3)', you should return 4.
